[Work in week]

(1) Investigate IP routing function
	Q&A:
	* After getting information from OS, do we need to save these information to Mpara_cur? --> NO
	* When users execute delete a route. Our understanding is as below:
		- If destination address field is empty --> Delete route, do not care about netmask address and next hop address.
		Is it correct? --> YES
		- If destination address field is not empty but netmask and next hop are empty
		What happen? 
		- Do we need to handle this case? Or TSPM console will check input parameter and display error message. --> TSPM will check (confirm again)
	* If users input duplicate routes, does TSPM console check this case? --> FW will check
